DATA_TYPE:
96 Bytes long
First member string - double int - 4 Bytes -- length of string (don't need to really worry about)
82 Bytes after are ASCII characters 
Int with scanner number - 2 Bytes
Int with transaction ID - 2 Bytes
End bit -- double integer - 4 Bytes

WRITING BACK
DESTINATION: 'SORTER_1_RESPONSE'
Send back transaction ID to ensure correct communication -- + the destination -- written into data type:
4 Bytes wide
3 members: 
1: transaction id 
2: destination (single int) 
3: end (single int, 1)

AFTER SORTING:
'SORTED_1_REPORT'
96 Bytes
Barcode -- same as sorted car
Tracking flags: Active, Lost, Good, Diverted: Inner data type w/ 4 Booleans (1 byte wide each)
End bit - double integer - 4 Bytes
Do with data what I want
This bardcode went to X destination and Y is the reason
Start logging like: packages lost, not diverted because motor is working or dest not available etc
